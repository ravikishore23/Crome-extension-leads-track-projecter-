Of course! Here's a **different style** of README for your **Lead Tracker Chrome Extension** — more professional and a little more energetic, but still super clear and project-ready:

# 🚀 Lead Tracker - Chrome Extension

**Lead Tracker** is a lightweight Chrome extension that lets you **save URLs** quickly and easily.  
Store leads manually by entering a URL, grab the **current tab** instantly, and manage your saved leads — all from a simple popup interface!

---

## ✨ Features

- **Save Manual URLs:** Add links by typing and saving.
- **Capture Active Tab:** Instantly save your current tab’s URL with one click.
- **Delete All:** Clear all saved leads when you’re done.
- **Persistent Storage:** Your leads stay saved even when you close Chrome.
- **Clean UI:** Minimal and user-friendly design.

Would you also like a **cooler "badge style"** README? (like the ones with shields.io badges for version, license, etc?)  
I can also design one if you want it to look super pro! 🚀🎨  
Should I show you? 🎯
